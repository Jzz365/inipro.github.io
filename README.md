        <p>When clearing out some of my old programming books the other day I realised how far I’d come with programming over the years, and the number of different technologies that I have used over time. I thought I’d do a little summary post going from first programming experience to now – and it’s amazing what’s changed.</p>

        <p>My first proper programming experience was with a BBC Micro computer. You can tell how old I am (fairly young I know, but relatively old in computing terms) that when I was at primary school we had four computers – three BBC Micros and one Acorn machine. The machine I was using had a 5 1/4″ floppy drive (as pictured above), but the book that I used to teach me how to program assumed that I’d be using an audio cassette recorder to store my programs on – how awesome is that? Old-school yes, but practical, after all, most people had a tape recorder available (in those days at least). Anyway I managed to find a book called BBC Basic for Beginners which taught me how to write simple programs – think guessing games, simple asking questions programs (“What is your name?”, “Hello &lt;NAME&gt;”). I distinctly remember trying to persuade a friend to stay in during break time and write a program with me. He wasn’t interested – but oh well.</p>
